1970s I was born just after WW2 ended and inherited a strong passion for London's history from my father. Growing up in Hackney, a mere bus ride away from central London, meant my teens and twenties were spent in a series of secretarial jobs in and around Soho and the West End. Nothing seemed to stick. I job hopped for years. But in the early 1970s a brief,intense affair with a thirtyish Fleet Street reporter, a 'casual' working at the Daily Express Art Deco building in the heart of the Street and the Evening News, just off the Street in Carmelite Street, kickstarted my aspiration to actually work there. Trotting down those narrow, crowded streets to meet him after his shift fired my imagination as never before. Here was the very heart of the action, where everything of significance could be fed, day and night, into millions of homes.<br><br> The relationship fizzled out. I remained determined to get into the fray, be part of the inky enterprise. 'I work in Fleet Street' seemed like an accolade, even a badge of honour. There were hundreds of Central London secretarial jobs around. But there were no secretarial jobs advertised in any of the big nationals. How come? An employment agency woman set me straight. All the best secretarial jobs in Fleet Street were advertised internally. The jobs were so good, the girls didn't leave. Back then, the mighty trade unions held sway. First I had to find a secretarial job within the print environment itself. That way I'd be required join the appropriate print union – Natsopa - and only then, as a union worker, would I be eligible to apply for my coveted Fleet Street job..<br><br> I toiled in the boring planning section of the former IPC magazines in Covent Garden. After six months I scanned the advertised internal jobs, posted weekly outside the huge lifts on the ground floor. Secretary to the news editor of the Sunday Mirror, housed in the huge Mirror building on High Holborn, sounded perfect. I went to 33 Holborn and briefly met the news editor, Monty Court. I passed muster. I was in!

			What I didn'tunderstand that very first September day when I nervously took the fourth floorlift into the open plan Sunday Mirror newsroom was that I was half of a twogirl news desk secretarial setup. (Overmanning was the order of the day courtesyof union diktat) Sitting opposite me, perfectly tanned from her sunshineholiday, greeted by all with obvious pleasure, sat a very slim, beautifullyattired girl around my age: Jenny Best. We'd work in tandem. Hers was thesenior role. Could this work? I'd been around offices, knew the importance ofgetting on well with close colleagues. It didn't always pan out..<br><br> Even on that first strange day, Jenny and Monty a very lively. outspoken individual, hadclearly bonded long ago. How could the new girl fit in? Would Jenny stay aloof,overprotective of her territory? Not a bit of it. Within days I understood thateditorial life of the Sunday Mirror, whose circulation ran to five million,carried two significant drivers: humour and camaraderie were very much to thefore. Women, ie secretaries and a handful of female reporters, were, at that time, in the minority: all were treated with an old fashioned courtesy. AndJenny, whose rapier like wit matched Monty's and often surpassed most of theyoung newsroom journalists, did not behave as Queen Bee. She briefed me onwhatever I needed to know, shared it all, including the incessant wittyasides.We were a team. I stayed at the news desk for three and a half years,Tuesday to Saturday, 10-6. Everything about the job suited me: the laughter,the pub culture, the unusual hours. .<br><br>The work was routine: typing memos, runningoff documents with an ancient spirit duplicator, a Banda, handling innumerablecalls to the news desk via a green metal desk top console, directing thetraffic: reporters calling in from a job, readers ringing for a host ofreasons, often turning up at the downstairs reception. Every single call washandled with discretion and professionalism: we were a national newspaper witha huge audience of ordinary people. They all mattered. A Fleet Street pub, back then, wasvirtually an extension of the office. Ours was the Stab sited at the rear ofthe building. Inside its door the office camaraderie , the incessant banter andthe gossipy, steamy world of journalists everywhere ebbed and flowed, day andnight in a consistent stream of words, wit – and laughter. I loved it all. Yetinstinct told me this was not where I should linger. A chance invitation froman Australian friend led to a snap decision: Jenny was starting a family, Iwould take my chances in Sydney;we farewelled the desk on the same day in March 1976. Nearly half a centurylater we still meet up, once a year, to recall those times. I had schemed toget in but the Sunday Mirror newsdesk was a wise choice: it propelled meonwards into a life I'd never

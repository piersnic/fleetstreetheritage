      <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"> I responded to an advertisement 
        in The Star newspaper, a sister paper to The News Chronicle and was interviewed 
        at the papers offices in Bouverie Street for the position of messenger 
        boy. Shortly afterwards I received a job offer to start on 5th April 1956 
        aged 15 at the princely sum of &pound;3:2:0 per week. On the day in question 
        I did as my mum advised ,and dressed in a suit and tie whereas ,other 
        boys present were in jeans and tee shirts. I truly believe this is why 
        I was sent to the publishing office instead of the messenger boy pool. 
        Mr Sam Mervyn- Herbert was the boss of the company 's publishing including 
        I-Spy books a hugely popular series of children's books that sold in their 
        millions at 6d, 1/- and 2/6d but huge income was from Michelin Maps and 
        Guides of which we had world wide sales rights excluding France. </font></p>

    <td  width=450><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">After six months 
      the post room boy was off to do his National Service and I applied for his 
      Job and started in October and that necessitated joining as a junior the 
      mighty NUPBPW ( National Union of Printing Bookbinding and Paper Workers)with 
      a weekly subscription of 2/6d. I ran the post room very enthusiastically 
      enjoying my job and working many hours of overtime. In those days you were 
      a junior until you were 21 so when Cadbury's the owners closed the paper 
      on 17th October I was still a junior 
      <p>unately the publishing company was kept and named The Dickens Press after 
        Charles Dickens who was the first editor of The Daily News later to become 
        The News Chronicle. The Dickens Press relocated to Upper Thames Street 
        in 1961 next door to The Mermaid Theatre backing on to The River Thames. 
        Later that year I reached my majority (21) and when in conversation with 
        Mr Herbert he asked me what department I would like to work in and suggested 
        I should sell our books. Until then and still settling into our new location 
        we had relied on sending out order forms. He said he liked the idea and 
        would think about it, Soon it had been decided that they would buy a small 
        van fill it with I Spy Books and set me free selling to newsagents in 
        London. It proved over very successful and within 2 years I was now driving 
        a nice estate car and taking orders for all of our range of titles at 
        which point more sales people were taken on. I became the senior sales 
        person when a sales director was appointed and flourished in this position 
        until 1969 when I left to take up the position for a small children's 
        publisher and after 2 years left to start my own business Grange Books 
        Ltd.</p>

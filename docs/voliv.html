Personal stories from Fleet Street <br><br>
This new section of our website is for the ersonal stories of those who worked in Fleet Street during the 'hot metal' era before 
	computerised typesettingtook over, and the newspapers moved away from their traditional homes in and around Fleet Street
	into bildings elsewhere which were more suitable for the new technology<br><br>
	We hope that these stories will give you a flavour of what Fleet Street was actually like, with its very crowded pavements, 
	its roads jammed with traffic including large lorries loaded with very large rolls of newsprint, and small vans painted with newspaper slogans 
	dashing off to railway stations with copies of newspapers for national distribution.

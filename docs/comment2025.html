      Fleet Street Heritage Wall<br>

      The inclusion of semi-permanent, detailed information in the Fleet Street 
      Heritage Wall would add greatly to the accessibility of historical understanding 
      by residents of and visitors to this iconic area of the City. The sundial 
      already promises to improve the aesthetic perception of what would be otherwise 
      an unsightly blank wall. Adding the information tiles would further this 
      purpose. As one of the few architectural historians specialising in the 
      City of London, I strongly support this initiative. <br>

      I write as Chairman of the Jubilee Walkway Trust (until we branched out 
      into the Commonwealth in 2012). This was created in 1977 by Max Nicholson, 
      the father of Piers Nicholson, whose proposal this is. I fully support the 
      Application on the grounds that it is of historical importance and will 
      be most interesting in informing the general public. Therefore it enriches 
      London. I see it as wholly positive<br>

      I am a City of London Guide and I do tours in Fleet Street. I think this 
      artwork would be a great asset to the Fleet Street neighbourhood. It will 
      encourage people to stop, look and then maybe explore the alleys around 
      Fleet Street. With the new developments in Fleet Street and the development 
      of the BID it can only enhance the public realm. <br>

      I lived near Fleet Street for many years and still visit frequently. The 
      tiles beneath the sundial on Bouverie Street, EC4, are a brilliant idea. 
      They would offer a more detailed history of press freedom in the UK while 
      complementing the sundial above. Fleet Street has an incredibly rich history-it 
      was here that British press freedom was forged and fiercely defended. Few 
      people today realize that this was not achieved overnight. Coming from a 
      country where the press is far from free even today, I find it especially 
      meaningful and valuable to reflect on how Britain secured this right. What 
      a fantastic initiative! <br>

      I am a local resident having lived here for 10 years, and Rector of the 
      Ward Church of Castle Baynard. This proposal seems to me to help interpret 
      the history of the area to visitors and local workers. As the memory of 
      Fleet St as a place of print media fades, this will be an appropriate way 
      to make it known, and help people to interpret the built environment which 
      still in the Express, Telegraph and Daily Sketch buildings, among others, 
      including Punch Tavern, retains memories of the newspaper industry that 
      was once centred here. <br>

      I write in support of this application as a local business and in the capacity 
      as Development Manager on behalf of the owners of both Peterborough Court 
      and Daniel House, diagonally opposite 62 Fleet Street. The lower sections 
      of wall forming the subject of the application are currently very plain. 
      I note that this wall will be revitalised by the applicant proposing to 
      install high quality ceramic panels depicting fascinating local, historic 
      buildings, businesses and personalities throughout the ages. It is a well 
      considered and exciting proposal. Fleet Street is well known for its former 
      printing heritage, but there is very little evidence of it remaining today. 
      Furthermore, Fleet Street has association with fascinating characters from 
      the printing, scientific and business communities since the early 1500's 
      and again, there is little evidence to be found by residents, let alone 
      tourists in our neighbourhood. This proposal addresses these shortcomings. 
      The exhibition proposals will be a very welcome, impressive and timely stimulous 
      in our neighbourhood to promote its unique history. It is very important 
      that vitality and commerce is encouraged to return to Fleet Street and our 
      local business community by projects like this. It will certainly compliment 
      the exhibition in Magpie Alley and if approved, will undoubtedly become 
      an important destination attraction for tourists and a source of pride for 
      those in our community for years to come. Once again, I fully support this 
      application. </font> </td>

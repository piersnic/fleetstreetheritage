      Fleet Street Heritage Wall<br>

	  As an architect with a special interest in how data and information can be harnessed to improve people's lives, I am supporting this proposal to enhance the Fleet Street Sundial wall with a richly informative display of the fascinating heritage of Fleet Street.
<br><br>
Located below the prominent mastheads of five historic newspapers - the Fleet Street Sundial - the Heritage Wall panels tell the story of Fleet Street as the centre of the newspaper industry, with well-researched stories of its people and places, architecture and monuments, history and ideas.
<br><br>
The City of London suggested in 2021 the addition of heritage information panels to the planning application for the Fleet Street Heritage Sundial - a resource for visitors to London and for locals to enjoy. This design makes a coherent and engaging 'newspaper on a wall' design from an array of ninety-four heritage panels.
<br><br>
Legibility and accessibility have been well considered in the design of the heritage wall:
<br><br>
- Clear section headings guide viewers quickly to the part of the display of most interest to them.
<br><br>
- QR codes are integrated in the design, linking each panel to its digital counterpart on the FleetStreetHeritage.co.uk website. Visitors can view content on their own device, in a format to suit their needs e.g. larger text, or save for reading later.
<br><br>
- The digital webpages also have an audio link for visitors who prefer to listen.
<br><br>
- These features will make this important information resource accessible to a wide range of people. It exemplifies the careful thought which has gone into all aspects of this planning application.
<br><br>
I support the application and will look forward to seeing the Heritage Wall become a reality.<br><hr>

As an accredited City of London guide, I share the City's rich history with guests from London, the rest of the UK and the wider world. Fleet Street is a unique district - and we must celebrate and showcase the important role it has played for centuries in the dissemination and democratisation of information.
This heritage wall would be a welcome addition to a street undergoing transformation. It's vital we make the history accessible to all - at street level. I fully support t
his proposal.<br>

I strongly support the installation of tiles below the Heritage Sundial at the top of Bouverie Street.
I'm a City of London Guide and bring people on walks here. Magpie Alley and it's tiles is a hidden gem which 
people are delighted to discover. They tell me they go back there and bring friends to see it. The new tiles would be close 
by and would be seen by many more people as they walk along Fleet Street. I sincerely hope this project goes ahead, it will be an
 important record of the history of Fleet Street.<br>

This proposal would be a great extension to the existing sundial and information plaques. I lead guided tours in the area and it's one
 of the points of interest along the route which always attracts attention. Along with the wonderful tile wall in Magpie Alley this will 
 provide a depth of information and historical context in appealing visual form. I wholeheartedly support this proposal.<br>

As the archivist at the Inner Temple I strongly support this proposal.

The rich history of Fleet Street is fascinating to many. The tiles will be both aesthetically pleasing and informative, 
allowing many to discover what once lay beneath their feet - from the lands belonging to the Knights Templar to the great newspaper 
empires of Fleet Street. It is important to keep this history alive, and the tiles will achieve this perfectly.<br>

I graduated in English Literature at Sorbonne University last year and worked on the history of Fleet Street in my Master's thesis :
 I come to London on a regular basis to carry out research work. The Fleet Street heritage wall is a great way to make accessible historical 
 and cultural data about one of the main thoroughfare of the City. Its patrimony is very rich and diverse, full of great stories that the publi
 c, be they tourists or locals, would be glad to know about. This initiative, quite different from the mindset of advertisement, is also a way to adorn the
  city with something that gives meaning to surroundings rather than engages in consumption.<br>

Dear Madam/Sir

Dominus is a leading real estate investor, developer and asset manager.

We are currently on site at 65 Fleet Street delivering a mixed-use development that includes refurbishing and extending the 
Tipperary Pub, providing public access to the Whitefriars Crypt, delivering a new cultural space designed in partnership with
 St Bride Foundation, and creating a new public courtyard.<br><br>

We are pleased to write to the City of London to support the following planning application made by Fleet Street Heritage CIC at 6
2 Fleet Street (ref: 24/01325/FULL):<br><br>

Works to Fleet Street Heritage Wall including: (i) placement of 3 rows of A3 ceramic tiles across the length of the Wall; (ii)
 relocation of 2 existing plaques to new positions and addition of a plaque below the 3 existing; and (iii) repaving of the private area
  beneath the wall and within title 80056.<br><br>

Our 65 Fleet Street site faces the application site (62 Fleet Street) across Bouverie Street.<br><br>

We agree with the applicant (Fleet Street Heritage CIC) that the blank lower part of the wall at 62 Fleet Street presents a great
 opportunity to animate the local streetscape and presents an ideal canvas for the stories that the Fleet Street Heritage Wall will tell.

Yours faithfully<br>

      The inclusion of semi-permanent, detailed information in the Fleet Street 
      Heritage Wall would add greatly to the accessibility of historical understanding 
      by residents of and visitors to this iconic area of the City. The sundial 
      already promises to improve the aesthetic perception of what would be otherwise 
      an unsightly blank wall. Adding the information tiles would further this 
      purpose. As one of the few architectural historians specialising in the 
      City of London, I strongly support this initiative. <br>

      I write as Chairman of the Jubilee Walkway Trust (until we branched out 
      into the Commonwealth in 2012). This was created in 1977 by Max Nicholson, 
      the father of Piers Nicholson, whose proposal this is. I fully support the 
      Application on the grounds that it is of historical importance and will 
      be most interesting in informing the general public. Therefore it enriches 
      London. I see it as wholly positive<br>

      I am a City of London Guide and I do tours in Fleet Street. I think this 
      artwork would be a great asset to the Fleet Street neighbourhood. It will 
      encourage people to stop, look and then maybe explore the alleys around 
      Fleet Street. With the new developments in Fleet Street and the development 
      of the BID it can only enhance the public realm. <br>

      I lived near Fleet Street for many years and still visit frequently. The 
      tiles beneath the sundial on Bouverie Street, EC4, are a brilliant idea. 
      They would offer a more detailed history of press freedom in the UK while 
      complementing the sundial above. Fleet Street has an incredibly rich history-it 
      was here that British press freedom was forged and fiercely defended. Few 
      people today realize that this was not achieved overnight. Coming from a 
      country where the press is far from free even today, I find it especially 
      meaningful and valuable to reflect on how Britain secured this right. What 
      a fantastic initiative! <br>

      I am a local resident having lived here for 10 years, and Rector of the 
      Ward Church of Castle Baynard. This proposal seems to me to help interpret 
      the history of the area to visitors and local workers. As the memory of 
      Fleet St as a place of print media fades, this will be an appropriate way 
      to make it known, and help people to interpret the built environment which 
      still in the Express, Telegraph and Daily Sketch buildings, among others, 
      including Punch Tavern, retains memories of the newspaper industry that 
      was once centred here. <br>

      I write in support of this application as a local business and in the capacity 
      as Development Manager on behalf of the owners of both Peterborough Court 
      and Daniel House, diagonally opposite 62 Fleet Street. The lower sections 
      of wall forming the subject of the application are currently very plain. 
      I note that this wall will be revitalised by the applicant proposing to 
      install high quality ceramic panels depicting fascinating local, historic 
      buildings, businesses and personalities throughout the ages. It is a well 
      considered and exciting proposal. Fleet Street is well known for its former 
      printing heritage, but there is very little evidence of it remaining today. 
      Furthermore, Fleet Street has association with fascinating characters from 
      the printing, scientific and business communities since the early 1500's 
      and again, there is little evidence to be found by residents, let alone 
      tourists in our neighbourhood. This proposal addresses these shortcomings. 
      The exhibition proposals will be a very welcome, impressive and timely stimulous 
      in our neighbourhood to promote its unique history. It is very important 
      that vitality and commerce is encouraged to return to Fleet Street and our 
      local business community by projects like this. It will certainly compliment 
      the exhibition in Magpie Alley and if approved, will undoubtedly become 
      an important destination attraction for tourists and a source of pride for 
      those in our community for years to come. Once again, I fully support this 
      application. </font> </td>

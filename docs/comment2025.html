      As a Londoner, I greatly regret many of the changes that have taken place 
      to Fleet Street in recent decades. Little remains of its recent history 
      and atmosphere, especially its association with the press, so that 'Fleet 
      Street' (a highly evocative shorthand) is now meaningless. The proposed 
      ceramic wall would commemorate its longer history as well as its journalistic 
      one and would become a most welcome conduit of that story to London residents 
      and tourists alike, as well as an enhancement to the lovely sundial which 
      already gives such pleasure.

      I am not a resident of London, though I am often passing by this sundial, 
      and have been intrigued by it and the Fleet Street past that it highlights. 
      More information would have been welcome and seeing this proposal makes 
      me think it hits just the right note. I think this would be of general interest, 
      and benefit enjoyment of the sundial and wider appreciation of the importance 
      of Fleet Street in the national story. I didn't think there are any downsides 
      (I don't imagine any people reading the panels would cause any nuisance)

      I worked for over a decade in Chancery Lane. Whilst tourist footfall between 
      the Strand/Westminster and the City of London is strong, the history of 
      Fleet Street is getting easier and easier to miss. The sundial is already 
      very eye-catching, and I very much support this project to further highlight 
      and contextualise Fleet Street and its important role in London's media 
      and communications.

      Nicholson's sundial on the Bouverie Street wall adjoining Fleet Street.I 
      practise in Chambers nearby at 7 King's Bench Walk, Temple, and walk regularly 
      up Fleet Street. I regard the sundial as a very positive feature on the

      book The Heritage of Fleet Street. The proposed Heritage Wall at street

 <hr>I would like to express my strong support for the proposed Fleet Street Heritage Wall on
the corner of Bouverie Street and Fleet Street.
As someone who regularly guides Londoners and international visitors through this
historic area, I know first-hand how little is currently visible of Fleet Street's unique and
vital legacy in journalism and publishing. The proposed ceramic tile panels beneath the
Heritage Sundial would be a superb and much-needed addition to the streetscape-
bringing accessible, visually engaging, and historically rich content to the very heart of the
area.
On a personal note, my late uncle began his career in journalism on Fleet Street in the
1950s. This project not only celebrates the legacy of print media but also gives families
like mine a chance to see that legacy honoured in public space.
The integration of QR codes and audio links shows thoughtful attention to accessibility
and will allow the history of this iconic street to reach an even wider audience. This
initiative enhances both the aesthetic and educational value of the site, and I firmly believe
it will contribute to increased engagement, footfall, and civic pride.
I strongly urge the City of London to approve this well-conceived and meaningful
proposal.</font>

also the Sundial above the proposed heritage wall which so strikingly commemorates Fleet
Street's long association with the newspaper industry. These important additions to the
showcasing and wayfinding of the area are integral to the ambitions of the new cultural
strategy for the Fleet Street Quarter and to the City's ambitions for Destination City.

      It is likely that the majority of British and foreign tourists visit Fleet 
      street out of<br>
      historical curiosity rather than in search of artistic or architectural 
      treasures. But they<br>
      may well find that a walk down the street is a frustrating experience because 
      there is<br>
      currently surprisingly little visible or easily accessible information along 
      the street<br>
      about the locality's rich past.<br>
      Fleet street has had a great impact on British life over the last three 
      hundred years<br>
      or more and its history badly needs to be explained more clearly to visitors. 
      A series<br>
      of texts such as this project envisages would do much to focus attention 
      on the<br>
      institutions, buildings and events that have made the street such a significant<br>
      historical site.<br>
      For which reason I wholeheartedly commend the proposal to the committee.<br>

      and Officer of the Castle Baynard Ward Club, I have become well acquainted 
      with the area. I am particularly interested in the history of the City. 
      Starting work there in 1965, I have witnessed an enormous change in the 
      buildings within the City, but in spite of the expansion to Canary Wharf, 
      the City's main business has continued to be Finance. However what we have 
      in Fleet Street is destruction of the Newspaper printing industry which 
      was concentrated in the area. Fleet Street was internationally synonymous 
      with Newspapers., and its history should be displayed there. The Bouverie 
      Street Sundial gives an exciting visual display to catch the eye of the 
      passers by and whet their appetites for more information on the industry 
      and numerous Newspapers which were the lifeblood of Fleet Street. The proposed 
      Heritage Wall of ceramic tiles is the required adjunct to the interest engendered 
      by the Sundial Wall. It will give a vital and detailed history in the most 
      exciting way. The QR codes on each panel will expand access to more information

      I have many years experience or working in this area and have been invoIved

      of the information which the scheme conveys to the public is unique. There 
      is a rich cultural and historic heritage in the area which has a powerful 
      social and architectural history. Even though there is a dearth of Grade 
      1 listed buildings, the area contains a wealth of architectural detail which 
      passes largely uncommented on and would remain so if it were not for this 
      display. I am of the opinion that the authors of this work are communicating 
      an invaluable selection of information to visitors to the Fleet Street area

      I am writing on behalf of Fleet Street Quarter BID. We were formally established 
      on 1 April 2022 and represent over 350 businesses located in and around 
      Fleet Street. We are working with our partners to create a world class destination 
      here in Fleet Street, making it a dynamic leading business quarter with 
      high quality public spaces. Fleet Street is synonymous with the newspaper 
      industry which is why it is one of the few City of London streets found 
      on the original Monopoly Board. But there is little visual reference to 
      this historic legacy on Fleet Street and with the major changes currently 
      underway with several major developments, there is a risk that the few visual 
      historic remains might be lost. This is why we have worked with the applicant 
      on the temporary display of the newspaper history in Hind Court. Whilst 
      the panels in nearby Magpie Alley are very informative, they are hidden 
      away and not visible to casual visitors and passers-by on Fleet Street. 
      The current sundial on Bouverie Street is eye catching and the proposed 
      exhibition panels to go at eye level underneath the sundial is very much 
      supported as a means of providing much needed visual references to the history 
      of the area. The fact that the panels in Magpie Alley is directly opposite 
      the site is a happy coincidence and will have the effect of signposting 
      more people to visit these and learn more about the area; which in due course 
      will complement the proposed cultural use in the ground floor of the development 
      at 65 Fleet Street. The proposal will revitalise the rather blank wall under 
      the sundial with high quality ceramic panels depicting local historic buildings, 
      businesses and personalities throughout the ages. It is a well considered 
      and informative proposal. It will hopefully draw more people to the area 
      and increase dwell time, leading to more trade for the near by retail premises 
      in this designated shopping centre. I therefore very much support the proposal 
      and hope that the City will grant planning permission.

      I would like to support this planning application for the provision of historical 
      information on Fleet Street on an empty wall in Bouverie Street. I am a 
      frequent visitor to Fleet Street, particularly to St Brides Church and I 
      always feel that it is a shame that there is today very little evidence 
      of the rich history of our national newspaper industry which dominated this 
      area for so long. The striking and imaginative sundial higher up on the 
      same wall in Bouverie Street goes some way to remedying this defect but 
      the detailed information boards proposed to complement this would provide 
      a far more interesting feature would be of great benefit to Londoners and 
      ought to prove a significant tourist attraction. Yours.<br>

      As the Archivist & Head of Collections for the Middle Temple, I am entirely

      and squares, represents an area rich in hidden history, which these plaques

      the experience of those visiting the area, and add to the sense of a place 
      in history for those who work and live nearby. The sheer breadth and diversity 
      of organisations, individuals, networks and industries represented in this 
      collection is scarcely parallelled, and to make these stories available 
      in this way would only be of benefit to Fleet Street, its people and the 
      community. This is a well-thought out and professionally presented proposal

      <BR>
      Located below the prominent mastheads of five historic newspapers - the 
      Fleet Street Sundial - the Heritage Wall panels tell the story of Fleet 
      Street as the centre of the newspaper industry, with well-researched stories 
      of its people and places, architecture and monuments, history and ideas. 
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      The City of London suggested in 2021 the addition of heritage information 
      panels to the planning application for the Fleet Street Heritage Sundial 
      - a resource for visitors to London and for locals to enjoy. This design 
      makes a coherent and engaging 'newspaper on a wall' design from an array 
      of ninety-four heritage panels. <BR>
      <BR>
      Legibility and accessibility have been well considered in the design of 
      the heritage wall: <BR>
      <BR>
      Clear section headings guide viewers quickly to the part of the display 
      of most interest to them. - QR codes are integrated in the design, linking 
      each panel to its digital counterpart on the FleetStreetHeritage.co.uk website. 
      Visitors can view content on their own device, in a format to suit their 
      needs e.g. larger text, or save for reading later. - The digital webpages 
      also have an audio link for visitors who prefer to listen. - These features 
      will make this important information resource accessible to a wide range 
      of people. It exemplifies the careful thought which has gone into all aspects 
      of this planning application

      to the great newspaper empires of Fleet Street. It is important to keep 
      this history alive, and the tiles will achieve this perfectly.<br>

      I graduated in English Literature at Sorbonne University last year and worked 
      on the history of Fleet Street in my Master's thesis : I come to London 
      on a regular basis to carry out research work. The Fleet Street heritage 
      wall is a great way to make accessible historical and cultural data about 
      one of the main thoroughfare of the City. Its patrimony is very rich and 
      diverse, full of great stories that the publi c, be they tourists or locals, 
      would be glad to know about. This initiative, quite different from the mindset 
      of advertisement, is also a way to adorn the city with something that gives 
      meaning to surroundings rather than engages in consumption.<br>

      The inclusion of semi-permanent, detailed information in the Fleet Street 
      Heritage Wall would add greatly to the accessibility of historical understanding 
      by residents of and visitors to this iconic area of the City. The sundial 
      already promises to improve the aesthetic perception of what would be otherwise 
      an unsightly blank wall. Adding the information tiles would further this 
      purpose. As one of the few architectural historians specialising in the 
      City of London, I strongly support this initiative. <br>

      I write as Chairman of the Jubilee Walkway Trust (until we branched out 
      into the Commonwealth in 2012). This was created in 1977 by Max Nicholson, 
      the father of Piers Nicholson, whose proposal this is. I fully support the 
      Application on the grounds that it is of historical importance and will 
      be most interesting in informing the general public. Therefore it enriches 
      London. I see it as wholly positive<br>

      I am a City of London Guide and I do tours in Fleet Street. I think this 
      artwork would be a great asset to the Fleet Street neighbourhood. It will 
      encourage people to stop, look and then maybe explore the alleys around 
      Fleet Street. With the new developments in Fleet Street and the development 
      of the BID it can only enhance the public realm. <br>

      I lived near Fleet Street for many years and still visit frequently. The 
      tiles beneath the sundial on Bouverie Street, EC4, are a brilliant idea. 
      They would offer a more detailed history of press freedom in the UK while 
      complementing the sundial above. Fleet Street has an incredibly rich history-it 
      was here that British press freedom was forged and fiercely defended. Few 
      people today realize that this was not achieved overnight. Coming from a 
      country where the press is far from free even today, I find it especially 
      meaningful and valuable to reflect on how Britain secured this right. What 
      a fantastic initiative! <br>

      I am a local resident having lived here for 10 years, and Rector of the 
      Ward Church of Castle Baynard. This proposal seems to me to help interpret 
      the history of the area to visitors and local workers. As the memory of 
      Fleet St as a place of print media fades, this will be an appropriate way 
      to make it known, and help people to interpret the built environment which 
      still in the Express, Telegraph and Daily Sketch buildings, among others, 
      including Punch Tavern, retains memories of the newspaper industry that 
      was once centred here. <br>

      I write in support of this application as a local business and in the capacity 
      as Development Manager on behalf of the owners of both Peterborough Court 
      and Daniel House, diagonally opposite 62 Fleet Street. The lower sections 
      of wall forming the subject of the application are currently very plain. 
      I note that this wall will be revitalised by the applicant proposing to 
      install high quality ceramic panels depicting fascinating local, historic 
      buildings, businesses and personalities throughout the ages. It is a well 
      considered and exciting proposal. Fleet Street is well known for its former 
      printing heritage, but there is very little evidence of it remaining today. 
      Furthermore, Fleet Street has association with fascinating characters from 
      the printing, scientific and business communities since the early 1500's 
      and again, there is little evidence to be found by residents, let alone 
      tourists in our neighbourhood. This proposal addresses these shortcomings. 
      The exhibition proposals will be a very welcome, impressive and timely stimulous 
      in our neighbourhood to promote its unique history. It is very important 
      that vitality and commerce is encouraged to return to Fleet Street and our 
      local business community by projects like this. It will certainly compliment 
      the exhibition in Magpie Alley and if approved, will undoubtedly become 
      an important destination attraction for tourists and a source of pride for 
      those in our community for years to come. Once again, I fully support this 
      application. </font> </td>

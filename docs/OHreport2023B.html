      in September 2023</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary_______________________________________________________ </b><br>
      The exhibition was held at the corner of Bouverie Street and Fleet Street 
      in the City of London between 14th and 17th September 2023. Our participation 
      in the Open House was designed to make the Fleet Street Heritage Project 
      more widely known, and to demonstrate that having a large number of heritage 
      information pages displayed in public together would generate plenty of 
      public interest. <br>

      <b><font size="4">Construction of the exhibit________________________________________</font></b> 
      Fleet Street Heritage CIC has no staff, so all the work of planning and 
      constructing this exhibit fell on the CEO. The information panels were printed 
      by the local KallKwik copy shop on large plastic sheets: 2 measured 3 m 
      by 1 m and contained 18 of our panels, and 2 were 1.7 m by 1m with 10 panels. 
      These sheets took 7 days to produce, and were thus not available when the 
      frameworks were constructed in Salisbury. The timber for these frameworks 
      had to be brought to London by train. The final construction was done on 
      the street in London. The method of fixing the sheets to the framework was 
      sub-optimal due to these constraints. <br>
      <br>
      <font size="4"><b> Mounting the exhibit on site._______________________________________ 
      </b></font>We had been told by the planning authority that we did not need 
      planning permission so long as there was no mechanical fixing to the wall. 
      The lightweight timber frames were therefore lent back on the wall. Windy 
      conditions on the fourth day of the exhibition caused all four of the frames 
      to be tipped forward on to the street, fortunately at a time no-one was 
      there. (See pictures below) <br>
      <br>
      <b><font size="4">Why was our exhibition part of the Open House 2023?__________________</font></b> 
      The Open House events are held every year in mid-September, This year 733 
      buildings and events were included. Their website gets a very large number 
      of hits, including our entry of 724 events spread over the four days from 
      Friday 17th to Sunday 21st September. Their website gets a huge amount of 
      publicity, so it was obviously better for us to participate in this event 
      rather than to mount an exhibition independently. Our exhibition was presented 
      as a joint event between the Heritage Sundial at the top of the wall, and 
      the exhibition of heritage panels at the foot of the wall. The exhibition 
      was presented in the form of 6 Q and A events a day - 3 of these were Sundial 
      Q and A's at 8,9,and 10 am when the sundial would have sunshine on it, and 
      3 were Heritage Q and A's at 11,12 and 1 pm. <br>
      <br>
      <font size="4">What were the results?__________________________________________ 
      </font>The results were very gratifying. We had 63 attendees registered 
      in advance (Thurs 21, Fri 23, Sat 6, Sun 13). Many more visitors came from 
      casual passers-by from Fleet Street. Visitors were curious about how the 
      east-facing sundial worked, and interested in the detail of some of the 
      56 heritage panels included in our exhibitors. They were also shown the 
      excellent book, produced this week by the Fleet Street Quarter which contains 
      70 of our pages, and many of them expressed a wish to buy the book when 
      it goes on public sale. <br>
      <br>
      <b><font size="4">Acknowledgements____________________________________________ 
      </font></b>Our main thank-you must be to the organisers of the Open House, 
      who created this great opportunity to advance our objectives. The Fleet 
      Street Heritage Project has been largely funded by the Community Infrastructure 
      Levy Neighbourhood Fund of the City of London. We have worked closely with 
      the Fleet Street Quarter, who kindly produced the book of all our pages 
      to a very tight schedule so it would be in time for the Open House.. We 
      were much helped by individuals who volunteered to assist our efforts on 
      site, particularly Jessica, Kishan, Veronika, Megan, Gillian and Luke <br>
      <br>
      <b><font size="4">The petition___________________________________________________ 
      <br>
      </font></b> We asked all our visitors to sign the petition given below, 
      and around 168 of them did so. The petition read "We urge the City of London 
      Corporation to do everything in its power to establish a permanent,, openly 
      accessible exhibition of ceramic tiles incorporating as many as possible 
      of the Fleet Street Heritage information panels as displayed at the Open 
      House 2023" <br>

		  Fleet Street Heritage Community Interest Company (CIC) was founded in 2020 under the name Fleet Street Heritage Sundial CIC.
		  The company has 3 directors: Piers Nicholson (who is the CEO), Nigel Springer, and John Latham. Nigel Springer is a director of the company which owns the wall on which the sundial is painted, and John Latham has been a member of the 
	          committee of the Castle Baynard Ward Club for many y ears 
		  <br> <br>
The Fleet Street Heritage Project was the inspiration of Piers Nicholson who designed the sundial. It was supported by a grant from the City of London Neighbourhood Fund and private donations. Many of the information panels are in this booklet. They were written by a variety of people and some of the pages have links to other sources of information. The Fleet Street Heritage project is a marvellous introduction to the history of Fleet Street which stretches back to the Middle Ages and beyond. We hope you enjoy reading the pages and finding out more about Fleet Street and its history.

¬¬The Fleet Street Heritage Project has two components, a sundial of 30 x 30 ft. in Bouverie Street with hour lines celebrating the newspapers which used to be published    in the Fleet Street area. The sundial was painted in situ by a London sign writer and is the biggest vertical wall sundial in the UK.

The second part of the Heritage project is an online resource of information panels describing many aspects of the history of  Fleet Street, the buildings, the newspaper industry and the people who lived there. 
<br><br>
We are continuing to add to the 80 pages already completed, and would welcome offers of help from people who might be interested in writing further pages, either from our list of Future Plans or on other topics relevant to Fleet Street.  We also welcome offers of financial help to enable us to further develop this unique project.

I first entered the The Daily Mirror building in Holborn, in 1962. <br><br><br><br>
The time was around 3 p.m. so almost everyone was still out to lunch. <br><br>
Mike Molloy, my best friend from art school days, had set me up for a job. He was the only Features Artist at the Mirror (he later went on to be Editor, then Editorial Director). <br><br>
Thanks to me, he was enjoying his first day off for weeks.    <br><br>
<br><br>
Security concerns were unheard of back then.<br><br>

The Features Department, my destination, was divided from the main newsroom by a metal wall about 3.5 feet high. The office was spacious, with about 20 desks, each with a typewriter chained stoutly to it, and a shiny black telephone<br><br>

The place was deserted except for a figure in one corner, stapling bus tickets to an expense sheet. This was, I later learned, Arthur Thirkell - the witty and learned Theatre critic, and a man of scrupulous honesty, viz, the bus tickets. <br><br>
He ignored me.<br><br>
I sat, awaiting instructions or acknowledgement. None was to be had.  <br><br>
<br><br>
I opened up a copy of the day's paper.<br><br>

Outside the wall in the main newsroom, people ambled by. They glanced at me, but said nothing.<br><br>

Finally a small uproar spilled out of the lifts, and a gaggle - one or two of whom seemed slightly the worse for drink - heaved alongside. They were Tony Miles, years later to become both Editor, then Editorial Director; John Edwards, newly back for a stint in our New York office (and still unhappy about being expelled from Paradise); Roy Blackman, Defence Correspondent; Sheila Duncan (who did girlie stuff); and general reporter Dixon Scott, who fancied himself a folksy dispenser of homespun wisdom. (I learned all this later.)<br><br>

Feature writer Tony Miles, future Leader of Men (and the occasional woman), looked over the wall at me, summed up the situation at a glance, and revealed himself to be the keen-eyed hack future generations would come to appreciate<br><br>

â€œWho's that cunt?'' he asked.<br><br>
...I was in.

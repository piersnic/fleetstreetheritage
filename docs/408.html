      <td  width=450> <font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"> I was born 
        in July 1948 in Hoxton in East London. When I was 15, I started to look 
        round for a suitable apprenticeship. I wanted to be an electrician, but 
        my father thought it would be better for me to go &quot;into the print&quot; 
        because his brother-in-law had some connections which could be useful. 
        At that time, there were no apprenticeships in the newspaper industry, 
        but here were many with printing firms. So I ended up applying for an 
        apprenticeship with Blades, East and Blades, a firm of security printers 
        with a factory which was in two whole city blocks near Old Street. I had 
        to take exams in general knowledge, maths, English and so on. There was 
        an interview and a medical. I passed them all, but I had to wait till 
        my sixteenth birthday before I could start work.<br><br>
        I had been told that the apprentice who scored top marks would be sent 
        to the composing room and the next one (which was me) would go to the 
        litho department. But I still had a month to wait 'till my birthday, so 
        I spent it as the office boy. I was well treated by the staff, but the 
        other apprentices were awful. They made a practice of picking up an office 
        ornament which had upward-facing spikes, and hammering it into the back 
        of the youngest apprentice until it drew blood. So the month passed, and 
        it turned out that they couldn't take another apprentice in the litho 
        department, so I was given the choice between the Master Printers department 
        (which meant taking more exams) or the warehouse dept (which was full 
        of women). <br><br>
        I had no wish to work with a lot of women, so I went to the Master Printers, 
        run by one Ernie Woodward, who was much disfigured, had a hunched back 
        and was very strict. I spent the first month learning how to set type 
        in a composing stick, and then to 'justify' the line by filling the paces 
        between words with small extra spaces until the line of type was exactly 
        the right length as the line above. You had to buy your own composing 
        stick, quoin key and tweeters etc. - there was no question then of the 
        company giving you the tools for you to do your job. Mr. Woodward was 
        the 'clicker' for all the work on the journal of the Institute of Bankers 
        - this work was done by 6 teams of 4 people under his direction. These 
        teams produced galley proofs of sections of the journal. The galley proofs 
        were sent off to the reading room, where they were marked up by proof-readers, 
        and returned to the composing room for the corrections to be made.<br><br>
	      The older staff 
        treated us tolerably well, and I learned to be humble and respectful to 
        all my elders. The other apprentices continued to be unpleasant, and many 
        evenings I would return home in tears. My father tried to help me stand 
        up for myself. Over this period, though the other apprentices continued 
        to be unpleasant. I changed from being a shy self-effacing boy into a 
        rather quick-tempered youth rather too ready to use his fists. I'm slightly 
        ashamed looking back on it.

        <The company closed around 1969, before I had finished my apprenticeship, 
          but I found a small firm of general printers which was prepared to take 
          me one for the final year of my apprenticeship. They only had 3 compositors 
          compared with the 60 or more at my last place, and the work was much 
          less demanding. But it did enable me to finish my apprenticeship.<br>
          I had become a union member many years earlier. The National Graphical 
          Association was quite powerful, and ran a closed shop, so you could 
          not be employed as a compositor unless you were a member. If you were 
          out of work, they would tell you of any openings which were coming up. 
          So I took casual jobs through them for 6 months. It worked fairly well 
          for me: I would be employed for two weeks with a four week gap before 
          my next casual job, but the two weeks' pay was enough to last me out 
          till the next job.<br> <br>
          Then I got a permanent job at another security firm, Waterlows. I was 
          made redundant after a bit. At this point, I finally got &quot;into 
          the print&quot; with a permanent job at Sporting Life, a Daily Mirror 
          publication. Computerisation was beginning to come in at this time, 
          so much of the typesetting was done by the computer. The computer output 
          was printed on bromide paper, and the compositors cut it to sections 
          and made up the pages., and it was then sent to the print room where 
          the bromide paper was dewaxed. There was a very good atmosphere in this 
          department, with a lot of camaraderie. If you were under pressure to 
          meet a deadline, other people would usually come over to help you out. 
          But in these larger organisations, you never knew anything of what was 
          going on in other departments; your working life was confined to your 
          department and the canteen.<br><br>

          In 1989, I left the world of &quot;the print'. For 2 years I was in 
          desktop publishing, and then 5 years as an insurance agent with Prudential 
          until they cut the commission rate, and then I moved to Earls Court 
          and Olympia. They had a large signwriting department, where all the 
          work was done by hand. A friend had been asked to set up a vinyl graphics 
          department, and he asked me to join him. It was hard work with long 
          hours, often working over weekends. I ended up as general manager.<br><br>
          I was fortunate after I retired to be asked to help out at the St. Bride 
          Institute, where I do presentations with two colleagues, a Monotype 
          operator and a Linotype operator, in their workshop which is filled 
          with type cases, old printing presses, .............</p>

                2023, we had an exhibition of 56 of our Heritage Panels under 
                the sundial.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">They were mounted on flimsy wooden 
                structures to avoid the need for planning permission, and they 
                gave a good impression of what the proposed Heritage Wall would 
                look like. This Open House event was popular, those who came liked 
                the wealth of information available, and many spent some time 
                looking at a number of pages, andothers came back to look again 
                later. 170 of them signed a petition asking the City of London 
                to do all it could to establish a permanent Heritage Wall of ceeramic 
                panels on this site, and a further 760 signed the later online 
                petition. </font></b></p>

                <b><font face="Arial" size="3">In January 2024, we were ready 
                to submit the planning application for the Heritage Wall. There 
                is &pound;640submission fee, and our company, the Fleet Street 
                Heritage CIC had spent all our City of London Neighbourhood Fund 
                grant. But fortunately the Fleet Street Quarter Business Improvement 
                District had offered to pay this on our behalf. . We decided to 
                delay the applicatin until we could table the project at a meeting 
                of the Culture, Heritage and Libraries Comittee of the City. Thhy 
                accepted our petition, but recomended that we should get in touch 
                with the newly-established City Arts Initiative This proposal 
                rfor all 84 of the Heritage Panels to be displayed on A3 ceramic 
                panels is shown below.</font></b> 
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">To us, it seemed a logical companion 
                to the sundial which trumpted out the fact that Fleet Street has 
                a centuries old connection with the newspaper industry. The Heritage 
                Wall fills in some of the detail. We did not envisage that people 
                would read allthe panelsl, but that theywould read the headings 
                of the pages, some would follow the QR codes to see the pages 
                on their phones, ipads or laptops, and many too would listen t 
                the audio version when these are posted lateer in the year. And 
                everybody would appreciate that here was a very large and easily 
                accessible source of information about this isconic area, which 
                they could revisit on the internet whenever they wished</font></b>

                <b><font face="Arial" size="3">It was June 2024 before we were 
                able to have detailed meeting with two officers of the CAI. They 
                expressed the view that the proposal was not attractive enough, 
                that the lettereing was too small, and that it did not conform 
                to their accessibility guidelines. We pointed out that our Open 
                House exhibit had attracted a very diverse audience, and evereyone 
                seemed to like it. They said that to get planning permission we 
                needed to put up a proposal which was much more attractive, and 
                only referred to the individual Heritage Pages by their title 
                and a one-line description. We did not agree with this concept, 
                but felt that we had to show willing, so we put up 4 diffeerent 
                proposla which met these specifications. These are shown in our 
                <a href=FSHPresentation7.pptx>FSHPresentation7.pptx</a> which was sent to the CAI officers, who 
                kindly submitted it to the full meeting of the CAI Committee, 
                which we understand was attended by a number of Chief Officers 
                and represntatives from English Heritage and other organisations.</font></b> 
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">We were sent a summary of the 
                comments from this meeting whcih were almost entirely negative 
                about all 4 of the schemeso. We were left feeling there was nothing 
                obvious we could do to get the planningpermission we needed for 
                the scheme, so the idea would probably lapse, and the Heritage 
                Wall would just be an imaginative idea and a wasted opportunity 
                to use this marvellous site under the sundial.
